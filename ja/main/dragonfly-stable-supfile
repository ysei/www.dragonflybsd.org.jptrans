# DRAGONFLY-STABLE-SUPFILE
#
# This file will by default maintain the DragonFly source code in /usr/src/
# by tracking the DragonFly_Stable tag.  This tag represents a 'reasonably
# stable' snapshot of the current development tree.
#
# If not running X, or invoking cvsup from a non-interactive script, then
# run it as follows:
#
#	cvsup -g -L 2 DragonFly-stable-supfile
#
# You may wish to change some of the settings in this file to better
# suit your system:
#
# host=<mirror_site>
#		This specifies the server host which will supply the
#		file updates.  If you leave it at its default a random
#		mirror site will be used.
#
# base=/usr
#		This specifies the root where CVSup will store information
#		about the collections you have transferred to your system.
#		A setting of "/usr" will generate this information in
#		/usr/sup.  Even if you are CVSupping a large number of
#		collections, you will be hard pressed to generate more than
#		~1MB of data in this directory.  You can override the
#		"base" setting on the command line with cvsup's "-b base"
#		option.  This directory must exist in order to run CVSup.
#
# prefix=/usr
#		This specifies where to place the requested files.  A
#		setting of "/usr" will place all of the files
#		requested in /usr (e.g., "/usr/src/bin",
#		"/usr/ports/archivers").  The prefix directory
#		must exist in order to run CVSup.
