<P><H3>(II) Getting This Help File</H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    Email a message to the request address of the list.  For example, if 
    the list is called 'test', you would email a message to
    'test-request@hostname.domain'.  On this server, it would be
    'test-request@lists.dragonflybsd.org'. 
    <P>
    The body of the message should contain a single line, left justified,
    containing the keyword 'help' in lower case.
    <P>
    The list server will generally respond with this help file.
    <P>
</UL>
<P><H3>(III) Authentication</H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    Many of the requests you make to the list server requires authentication.
    The list server authenticates a request by emailing a message back to you
    with a special Subject: line.  The message contains complete iunstructions.
    You normally <B>Reply</B> the message (such that the original Subject
    is still in the Subject: header, possibly with an <B>Re:</B> in front of
    it).  You must edit the <B>REJECT</B> clause in the Subject line to
    say <B>ACCEPT</B> if you want to go ahead and run your original command.
    <P>
    You must be sure to leave the ID clause intact or the list manager will
    not be able to authenticate your request.
    <P>
    The purpose of authentication is to ensure that a valid return email
    address exists and to disuade spammers from crashing the list.  The
    moderator has the ability to turn on authentication AND moderation for
    any request, so you may not get an immediate response.
    <P>
</UL>
<P><H3>(IV) Subscribing</H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    To subscribe to a list you normally send email to the -request address
    of the list, as in 'test-request@hostname.domain'.  The body of the
    message should contain the keyword 'subscribe' alone or, if you want
    to subscribe a third party address, the subscribe keyword may be followed
    by an email address.
    <P>subscribe
    <P>or
    <P>subscribe email-address
    <P>
    Unless the list is a digest-only list you will receive an email for
    each posting to the list.  If you wish to receive a digest version of
    the list (which could be delayed by a few hours) use the <B>subdigest</B>
    command instead of <B>subscribe</B>.
</UL>
<P><H3>(V) Third Party Subscribes</H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    A <I>Third Party Subscribe</I> occurs when person A subscribes person B
    rather then just himself.  This is normally allowed.  The list manager
    will most likely have recipient verification turned on, which means
    that person B will be sent an email asking him or her to acknowledge
    the subscription before that person is actually added to the list.
    <P>
    If you receive a third party verification request and you do not want to
    be on the list, simply ignore the mail.
</UL>

<P><H3>(VI) Posting from multiple email addresses </H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    By default, most lists only allow subscribed addresses to post to 
    the list.  You can add other addresses to the list with the 
    'alias' command.
    <P>alias email-address
    <P>This allows you to post to the list from another email-address
    without the list distribution being sent to that address.  You can add
    as many aliases as you like.
</UL>

<P><H3>(VII) Unsubscribing</H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    To unsubscribe from a list, send the 'unsubscribe' command.  You can
    also unsubscribe third parties by adding an email address.
    <P>unsubscribe
    <P>or
    <P>unsubscribe email-address
    <P>Note that if you have several list aliases, you should unsubscribe
    from those aliases as well as the one you are receiving the list on.
</UL>

<P><H3>(VIII) List Information</H3>
<UL>
    <P>
    You can request list-specific information with the 'info' command.
